### What They Do

Ramp is a financial operations platform that combines corporate cards, expense management, bill payments, vendor management, procurement, travel booking, and treasury (cash management) into one integrated solution. The company's value proposition centers on helping businesses "spend less" - they deliberately aligned their business model with customer cost savings, earning revenue from interchange fees rather than encouraging spending.

They serve customers ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies including Shopify, Figma, Notion, CBRE, Anduril, and Stripe.

## Pain Point Analysis

### Identified Challenges

#### 1. Scaling Customer Success Across 50,000+ Customers

**Evidence**: Job postings for Scaled Customer Success Managers explicitly state "placing a big bet on the belief that there is significant untapped potential in their self-service accounts"

**Description**: Ramp has grown from a startup to serving 50,000+ businesses in just 5 years. Managing activation, retention, and expansion at scale while maintaining personalized service for enterprise accounts is a significant operational challenge. CSMs manage books of 50-70 accounts each.

**Opportunity**: Account Health Dashboard can provide visibility into health signals across thousands of accounts, enabling proactive intervention before issues escalate.

**Confidence**: HIGH (Direct Evidence: 3, Quantified Impact: 2, Recency: 3, Source Diversity: 2)

#### 2. Multi-Product Expansion Visibility

**Evidence**: Company reports 200%+ net dollar retention driven by "combination of growth in underlying customer spend and launch of additional products"

**Description**: Ramp has 6 distinct product lines (corporate cards, expense management, bill pay, procurement, travel, treasury). Identifying which existing customers are candidates for additional products is critical for their land-and-expand model. Growth Account Managers are explicitly tasked with "expansion and retention."

**Opportunity**: Whitespace Visualizer can map which products each customer has adopted and surface expansion opportunities across all 6 product lines.

**Confidence**: HIGH (Direct Evidence: 3, Quantified Impact: 3, Recency: 3, Source Diversity: 2)

#### 3. Enterprise Customer Complexity

**Evidence**: "Ramp generates $100K+ ARR from 2,200+ enterprise accounts" - enterprise customers doubled YoY

**Description**: Ramp is moving upmarket aggressively. Enterprise accounts have complex buying committees requiring multi-threaded relationships. The push upmarket increases customer acquisition costs and puts retention under pressure.

**Opportunity**: Stakeholder Map can help visualize relationships across enterprise buying committees and identify gaps in relationship coverage.

**Confidence**: HIGH (Direct Evidence: 2, Quantified Impact: 3, Recency: 3, Source Diversity: 1)

#### 4. Renewal Pipeline Management at Scale

**Evidence**: CSMs manage 50-70 customers each; 50,000+ total customers on annual contracts

**Description**: With massive customer volume on annual contracts, managing renewal pipeline and ensuring proactive outreach at the right time is operationally challenging.

**Opportunity**: Renewal Tracker provides 90/60/30 day pipeline view to ensure no renewal falls through the cracks.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (Direct Evidence: 2, Quantified Impact: 2, Recency: 3, Source Diversity: 1)

#### 5. Competitive Pressure

**Evidence**: "The spend-management market has become crowded with well-capitalized peers like Brex and Airbase"

**Description**: Ramp competes against Brex, SAP Concur, Coupa, and others. Demonstrating differentiated value and ROI to customers is critical for retention.

**Opportunity**: ROI Calculator helps demonstrate concrete value during competitive situations and renewals.

**Confidence**: HIGH (Direct Evidence: 2, Quantified Impact: 2, Recency: 3, Source Diversity: 1)

## POC Recommendations

### Summary Table

| Rank | Tool | Difficulty | Rationale |
|------|------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Whitespace Visualizer | 3/5 | 6 product lines + land-and-expand model = high expansion potential |
| 2 | Account Health Dashboard | 3/5 | Explicit focus on activation/retention at scale |
| 3 | Renewal Tracker | 2/5 | 50K+ customers on annual contracts need pipeline visibility |
| 4 | Stakeholder Map | 3/5 | Enterprise customers doubled YoY, complex buying committees |
| 5 | ROI Calculator | 2/5 | Competitive pressure requires value demonstration |

### Detailed Recommendations

#### 1. Whitespace Visualizer (Recommended Starting Point)

**Why for Ramp**: With 6 distinct product lines and 200%+ net dollar retention driven by expansion, visualizing cross-sell opportunities across 50,000+ accounts is extremely high-value. This directly addresses their land-and-expand business model and supports the Growth Account Management team's explicit mandate for expansion revenue.

**Prompt File**: `poc-prompts/01-whitespace-visualizer.md`

#### 2. Account Health Dashboard

**Why for Ramp**: Ramp's job postings explicitly mention building and refining their Customer Success organization with focus on "activation, growth, and retention." A health dashboard enables the scaled CS motion they're betting on by surfacing at-risk accounts across their massive customer base.

**Prompt File**: `poc-prompts/02-account-health-dashboard.md`

#### 3. Renewal Tracker

**Why for Ramp**: Simple to implement but immediately valuable. With CSMs managing 50-70 accounts each and 50,000+ total customers, systematic renewal tracking prevents revenue leakage.

**Prompt File**: `poc-prompts/03-renewal-tracker.md`

#### 4. Stakeholder Map

**Why for Ramp**: Enterprise accounts doubled to 2,200+ YoY. These complex deals require multi-threading across buying committees - Finance, IT, Procurement. Stakeholder mapping supports their upmarket push.

**Prompt File**: `poc-prompts/04-stakeholder-map.md`

#### 5. ROI Calculator

**Why for Ramp**: Ramp's core value prop is "spend less" - they already emphasize savings. An ROI calculator reinforces this message during competitive situations with Brex/Concur and supports renewal conversations.

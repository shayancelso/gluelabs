## Query Optimization Tips

2. **Combine with site:** for targeted searches (linkedin, glassdoor, etc.)
3. **Add year** (2024, 2025) for recent information
4. **Try variations** of company name (full name, abbreviation, common misspellings)
5. **Use OR** for alternative terms (CRO OR "Chief Revenue Officer")
6. **Filter by role** using job titles in quotes
7. **Check careers pages** for tool stack and team structure insights

## What We Do

### One Sentence
Glue is a consulting-to-build studio that creates custom software tools for account management and sales teams.

### One Paragraph
Glue helps revenue teams operationalize their strategy by building lightweight, white-labeled tools tailored to how they actually work. We combine deep account management expertise with rapid software development to deliver ROI calculators, whitespace visualizers, work-back plans, and more — custom-built for each client, not configured from a template. Our clients get the strategic insight of a consultancy and the execution speed of a product studio, without hiring a full-time developer or buying bloated enterprise software.

### The Problem We Solve
Account management and sales teams know where their growth opportunities are, but they lack the tools to act on them. Off-the-shelf platforms like Gainsight and Gong are expensive, rigid, and built for generic use cases. Internal dev teams are too costly or too busy. So teams default to spreadsheets, slide decks, and manual processes — losing deals, missing whitespace, and wasting time on work that should be automated.

### Who We Solve It For
Customer-facing teams at SMB and mid-market companies (10–50 employees initially) who need account managers or sales reps to drive revenue, but cannot afford or justify a full-time developer. These are companies sophisticated enough to want better tools, but underserved by enterprise solutions.

## Target Customer

### Primary Audience
- **Company size:** 10–50 employees initially, expanding to mid-market
- **Industries:** Tech companies first, then professional services, medical device, food and beverage distribution, and other industries with account management functions
- **Roles:** Account managers, customer success managers, sales reps, revenue operations

### Buyer vs. User
| Role   | Who                                                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Buyer  | VP of Sales, VP of Customer Success, Head of Revenue Operations, or Founder/CEO |
| User   | Individual account managers and sales reps                          |

### What Are They Currently Doing Instead?
1. **Gainsight, Gong, or Salesforce** — expensive, rigid, underutilized
2. **Spreadsheets and slide decks** — manual, error-prone, not scalable
3. **Nothing** — gut feel, tribal knowledge, inconsistent processes

### Why Can't They Solve This Themselves?
- Full-time developers cost $150K+ fully loaded and are hard to hire
- Off-the-shelf tools require compromise and configuration they don't have time for
- They don't know custom-built solutions are even an option — this is a new category

## Our Differentiator

### Why Us Over a Developer?
Developers can write code, but they don't understand account management workflows, sales motions, or what makes a tool actually get adopted by a revenue team. Glue's founders have lived in these roles — we know the pain points because we've had them ourselves. You're not explaining your job to us; we're already fluent in it.

### Why Us Over Off-the-Shelf Tools?
Platforms like Gainsight are built for the average use case across thousands of customers. They're powerful but bloated, expensive, and force you into their way of working. Glue builds tools around your process, your data, your branding. It fits you — you don't have to fit it.

### The "Consulting to Build" Hybrid Explained
Traditional consultants give you a strategy deck and leave. Traditional developers build what you spec without questioning whether it's the right thing. Glue does both: we consult to understand the real problem, then we build the exact tool to solve it. Strategy and execution in one engagement.

### Our Unfair Advantage
- Founders with direct account management and customer success experience
- We understand the workflows, incentives, and blockers firsthand
- We can build fast and at low cost using modern development approaches
- Speed is our operational edge — we deliver in weeks, not quarters — but we position on quality and fit, not speed

## Business Model

### Pricing Structure
- **Subscription-based hosting** (monthly fee to keep tools live and maintained)
- **One-time professional services fee** for setup and customization
- **Tiered by user count**

### User Tiers
| Tier       | Users    |
|------------|----------|
| Starter    | <5 users |
| Growth     | 5–20 users |
| Scale      | 20–50 users |
| Enterprise | 50+ users (custom pricing) |

### Optional Buyout Model
Clients can choose to own the tool outright instead of subscribing — one-time purchase with optional ongoing support retainer.

### How Clients Pay
- Monthly or annual subscription
- Setup fee paid upfront or split across first few months
- Project-based pricing available for one-off builds

### Alternative Model Considered
- **Project-based:** $9K+ per solution with $1K go-live support (6 months)
- Fractional developer contracts through Lovable community

---

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Customer Acquisition Channels
- LinkedIn thought leadership and outbound
- Reddit communities (sales, customer success, RevOps)
- SEO content targeting pain points with Gainsight, Gong, Salesforce limitations
- Founder-led sales and warm network

### Early Strategy
- First few projects free or heavily discounted to build portfolio and case studies
- Document ROI and outcomes meticulously
- Use early clients as references and co-marketing partners

### Content Angles
- "What Gainsight won't tell you about whitespace"
- "Why your AMs are still using spreadsheets"
- "The $150K question: Do you really need a developer?"
- "Custom tools aren't just for enterprise anymore"

### Partnership Opportunities
- Revenue operations consultants
- Fractional CROs and CS leaders
- Agencies serving SMB tech companies
- Lovable and other no-code/low-code communities

---

## Future Vision

### Year 1
- Land 5–10 paying clients
- Build repeatable delivery process
- Establish portfolio and case studies
- Validate pricing and packaging

### Year 3
- 30–50 active clients
- Expand beyond tech into professional services, medical device, distribution
- Hire first dedicated delivery and account management roles
- Launch self-serve tier for simplest tools

### Expansion Markets
- Medical device companies
- Food and beverage distributors (Coca-Cola suppliers, restaurant accounts)
- Professional services (law firms, consulting, accounting)
- Any industry with account managers and underserved tooling needs

### Product Roadmap Ideas
- Template library for fastest deployment
- Integration marketplace (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack)
- AI-assisted whitespace identification
- Client portal for tool management and requests

### Team Growth Plans
- Founders handle sales, strategy, and delivery initially
- Contract developers and designers for builds
- First hires: delivery lead, then account manager
- Eventually: sales rep, marketing, additional builders

## Open Questions / Decisions to Make

### Things We're Still Figuring Out
- Exact pricing by tier (need market testing)
- Whether to lead with subscription or project-based for first clients
- How to communicate "custom tools" to a market that doesn't know it exists
- Brand visual identity (logo in progress)

### Experiments to Run
- Free pilots with 2–3 early clients to validate demand and refine delivery
- A/B test messaging: "custom tools" vs. "tools built for you" vs. "whitespace solutions"
- Content on LinkedIn and Reddit to gauge interest and refine positioning

### Assumptions to Validate
- SMBs will pay monthly for hosted tools (vs. wanting to own outright)
- Buyers understand the value without seeing the tool first
- Account managers will actually adopt tools we build (vs. ignoring them like Gainsight)
- We can deliver profitably at proposed price points
